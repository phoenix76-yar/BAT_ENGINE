For grass instance we could use:
http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4028/sponsored_feature_rendering_grass_.php?print=1

Basically grass placements are saved in special file
grass placement has local position to the shape it is placed on
and the positions are saved in the following format:
x, y, rotation around z axis, scale factor - layed out in 4 bytes
the only thing it would be necessary to think how to place grass on z axis
other way:

struct GrassInstancePlacement
{
	/ ****** NOTE: Those positions are local to the main mesh
	hfloat x;
	hfloat y;
	hfloat z;
	byte rz;
	byte scaleFactor;
};


Grass shapes could be then instanced.

Local to the main mesh means that it will be neccessary to apply initial shapes transform to all transforms
that will be constructed from those positions.
