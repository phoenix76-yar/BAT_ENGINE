Some tips:
Use short cuts in VS, the most popular ones:

Everything that goes into core lies in BEngine namespace, everything specific should lie inside it's own namespace for example:
Everything that is connected to rendering pipeline will lie in:
namespace BEngine
{
	namespace BGraphics
	{
		//All rendering related code...
	}
}


If a thread is doing nothing, instead of doing while(true) {} loop put it asleep !!! (will save CPU cycles).
