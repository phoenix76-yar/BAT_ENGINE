Few ideas for the problem of for one drawable multiple positions:
If drawable isn't supposed to be instanced, then one option would be to:
Create a separate copy of the original drawable but make pointers point to the original
data, such as vertex data, index data, material, etc.



For RSC's idea
We create one shape dictionary and for it one texture dictionary
